# ImageCarouselJS
Image Carousel created using JavaScript. Puts images into a node list which is then read as an index. The index increments and upon incrementing initiates the changeImage function which reads the index value and translates the image by -500px to create a carousel effect. Buttons were incorporated along with a resetInterval to allow proper viewing time upon changing images.
